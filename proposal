Pong-Squared
A game of pong that not only has paddles on the left and right but also on the top and bottom.
The game will be very similar to a regular game of pong and the code will be based on the code we already have. The top paddle will be controlled by player 1 or the user and the bottom will be controlled by player 2 or the computer. The user's second paddle will be independent of the paddle on the side but the computer's paddle will be linked when one is automated.
This project isn't combined.
Good outcome would be that I can program two paddles that are independent of their respective partners but controlled by the same keys.
Better outcome would be that I can program two paddles that are independent and controlled by separate keys
Best outcome would be that I can program two paddles that are independent and controlled by seperate keys, with the computer's paddles fully automated.
My next steps are actually finishing the pong programming before moving on to figuring out how to add another paddle
